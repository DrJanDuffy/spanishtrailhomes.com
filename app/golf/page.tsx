      'Spanish Trail\'s 27 holes reward players who understand how the desert seasons impact turf, wind, and shot selection. Overseed schedules typically wrap in early fall, delivering emerald-green fairways and receptive greens just in time for peak golf tourism. Winter mornings can be crisp, so members often schedule tee times mid-morning to catch warming sunlight while enjoying the dramatic contrast of snow-dusted Spring Mountains.',
      'During the summer, early tee times offer cooler temperatures and the best chance to experience the Sunrise nine\'s signature water features without afternoon winds. Conditioning remains stellar thanks to expert agronomy teams, and Spanish Trail\'s double-sided range stays open with misting fans and shaded hitting bays.'

    title: 'Instruction, Technology, and Player Development',
    paragraphs: [
      'Spanish Trail Country Club invests continuously in player development. The Golf Learning Center features swing studios with Foresight GCQuad, BodiTrak pressure mats, and high-speed cameras for detailed analysis. PGA professionals design lesson series tailored to beginners, competitive amateurs, and juniors charting a path toward collegiate golf. Fitness trainers collaborate with instructors to build strength and flexibility programs that boost longevity on the course.',
      'Members also receive invites to fittings hosted by premium brands, ensuring equipment is dialed to their swing DNA and Spanish Trail\'s unique course conditions. Contact the golf shop for program availability and pricing.'

    paragraphs: [
      'Competition thrives at Spanish Trail. The Men\'s Invitational draws players from across the West, while the Ladies Member-Guest showcases hospitality with themed decor, live music, and boutique gifting suites. Couples leagues, nine-and-dine events, and twilight shootouts fill the calendar, offering friendly formats for every skill level. Charity tournaments raise funds for local causes, combining golf with purpose and strengthening community bonds.',

    title: 'Real Estate Synergy with the Golf Experience',
    paragraphs: [
      'Many Spanish Trail homes are designed with the golfer in mind: motor courts that accommodate cart parking, patios positioned for panoramic fairway views, and outdoor kitchens ideal for post-round gatherings. Some estates even feature putting greens and chipping complexes that mimic club conditions. Dr. Jan Duffy curates home tours that showcase these amenities, explaining HOA guidelines for accessory structures, lighting, and landscaping that preserve sightlines and pace of play.',
      'For members who travel frequently, lock-and-leave villas near the Sunrise and Lakes practice facilities deliver ultimate convenience. Dr. Duffy evaluates each listing\'s proximity to cart paths, starter huts, and halfway houses, ensuring her clients can maximize their time on the course. She also advises on noise considerations, premium pricing for double-fairway exposure, and property enhancements that resonate with fellow golf enthusiasts when it is time to resell.'

    question: 'How do tee times work for members and their guests?',
    answer:
      'Members can book tee times up to seven days in advance using the Spanish Trail mobile app or by contacting the golf shop. Peak morning times typically fill first, especially on weekends and during major events. Contact the golf shop for guest policies, dress code guidelines, and pace-of-play expectations.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Are there reciprocal privileges with other clubs?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Spanish Trail maintains relationships with select premier clubs across the United States, allowing members to request reciprocal tee times when traveling. Opportunities vary by season, so contact the golf staff to arrange advanced requests.',

  {
    question: 'What golf programs are available for juniors?',
    answer:
      'Junior golfers can enroll in seasonal academies, year-round development programs, and travel teams that compete across Nevada. Instruction emphasizes fundamentals, etiquette, and tournament preparation. Parents appreciate mentorship from PGA professionals and the supportive culture among junior members. Contact the golf shop for program details and enrollment.',

  {
    question: 'Do Spanish Trail homes include golf memberships?',
    answer:
      'Golf memberships are independent of real estate purchases. However, some sellers negotiate initiation fees or membership introductions as part of the transaction. Dr. Jan Duffy reviews each listing\'s membership status and can introduce buyers to the membership director to understand dues and availability before submitting offers.',
