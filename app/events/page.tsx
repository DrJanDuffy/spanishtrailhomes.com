      'Spanish Trail Country Club approaches every celebration as a bespoke experience. Event stylists collaborate with clients to curate themes, floral artistry, lighting installations, and culinary journeys that rival five-star resorts. Whether it is an intimate anniversary dinner or a corporate gala welcoming hundreds, the planning team choreographs each touchpoint to reflect the host’s story. Dr. Jan Duffy connects clients with in-demand vendors—photographers, entertainment specialists, and experiential designers—whose work complements the club’s elevated aesthetic.',
      'Because the clubhouse sits within a private, guard-gated community, hosts appreciate the seamless guest arrival process: valet greets attendees, concierge guides them to reserved spaces, and the events team executes behind the scenes so the host can genuinely enjoy the night. Dr. Duffy provides checklists, timeline templates, and budgeting tools that help clients navigate decisions confidently, from custom stationery to late-night lounge activations.'

She connects couples with trusted officiants, beauty teams, and rehearsal dinner venues, while also highlighting Spanish Trail homes ideal for hosting family gatherings.
