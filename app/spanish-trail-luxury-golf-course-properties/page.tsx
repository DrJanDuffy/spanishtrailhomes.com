    question: 'How do golf course views impact Spanish Trail pricing?',
    answer:
      'Fairway and water-feature views add between 8% and 14% to comparable interior properties, depending on orientation and renovation level. Sunrise-facing patios on the Lakes course command premium pricing, while Canyon course homes with unobstructed Red Rock views draw competitive offers even before hitting the open market. I evaluate each listing with historical comps so you understand the exact value of its vantage point.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What renovations matter most for luxury golf homes?',
    answer:
      'Top buyers prioritize infinity-edge pools, outdoor kitchens, accordion glass walls, spa-level primary suites, and wellness amenities like cold plunge rooms or golf simulator bays. Spanish Trail’s architectural review committee has specific guidelines—I coordinate with approved architects and contractors to budget upgrades prior to closing.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How competitive is the luxury segment right now?',
    answer:
      'As of November 2025, luxury golf homes ($1.5M+) are averaging 43 days on market with negotiations tightening around 3% below list price. Properties above $2.5M with full renovations and furnished packages often attract cash buyers. I monitor every showing note and agent preview so my clients move quickly without overpaying.',
