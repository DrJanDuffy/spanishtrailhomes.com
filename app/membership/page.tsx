    title: 'Understanding Membership When Buying',
    paragraphs: [
      'Spanish Trail Country Club offers several membership categories—from full golf to young executive, corporate, or social. As your real estate agent, Dr. Jan Duffy helps you understand how membership works before you purchase a home. She explains the different tiers, typical initiation fees, and monthly dues so you can factor these costs into your budget alongside your home purchase.',
      'When you buy a Spanish Trail home, membership is not automatic—you apply separately through the club. Dr. Duffy can introduce you to the membership director and explain the application timeline so you can coordinate club access with your closing date.'
    ],
  },
  {
    title: 'Membership Categories at a Glance',
    paragraphs: [
      'Full golf members enjoy unlimited tee times across all 27 holes, tournament access, and reciprocal privileges at partner clubs. Social and lifestyle members access dining, tennis, pools, fitness, and the full social calendar without golf privileges. Young executive memberships offer reduced initiation fees for members under 40. Corporate memberships allow businesses to designate multiple users for client entertainment.',
      'Dr. Duffy provides an overview of each category so home buyers can evaluate which tier fits their lifestyle. She recommends contacting the club directly for current pricing and availability, and can facilitate that introduction.'
    ],
  },
  {
    title: 'Membership Transfers When Selling',
    paragraphs: [
      'Club memberships at Spanish Trail are personal—they do not transfer automatically with a home sale. However, sellers sometimes negotiate to cover a portion of the buyer\'s initiation fee as part of the transaction. Dr. Duffy has experience structuring these arrangements and can advise both buyers and sellers on common practices.',
      'For sellers who are club members, Dr. Duffy explains your options: you may resign your membership, retain it if purchasing elsewhere in Spanish Trail, or explore the club\'s policies on membership holds. She coordinates with the club\'s membership office to ensure a smooth transition.'
    ],
  },
  {
    title: 'Why Membership Enhances Home Value',
    paragraphs: [
      'Proximity to world-class amenities is a key selling point for Spanish Trail homes. Residents can cart to morning tee times, walk to the tennis center, or enjoy poolside dining without leaving the community. Buyers who value an active country club lifestyle often pay a premium for homes near the clubhouse or with golf course views.',
      'Dr. Duffy helps buyers find homes that match their intended use of club amenities—whether that\'s daily golf access, tennis and fitness focus, or primarily social and dining benefits. For sellers, she highlights membership benefits in marketing materials to attract buyers seeking this lifestyle.'
    ],
  },
]

const membershipFaq = [
  {
    question: 'How does membership work when buying a Spanish Trail home?',
    answer:
      'Club membership is separate from home ownership—buying a home does not automatically include membership. Dr. Jan Duffy explains the membership options and typical costs so you can budget accordingly. She can introduce you to the club\'s membership director to start your application process.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Are memberships transferable when selling a Spanish Trail home?',
    answer:
      'Memberships are personal and do not automatically transfer with a home sale. However, sellers sometimes negotiate to cover a portion of the buyer\'s initiation fee as part of the transaction. Dr. Duffy has experience structuring these arrangements for both buyers and sellers.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do dues differ between membership categories?',
    answer:
      'Full golf memberships carry the highest dues, reflecting extensive course access and tournament programming. Social and young executive memberships offer lower monthly investments while still providing access to dining, fitness, and social events. Contact the club directly for current pricing—Dr. Duffy can facilitate that introduction.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does Dr. Duffy represent the club or home buyers/sellers?',
    answer:
      'Dr. Duffy is a real estate agent representing home buyers and sellers in Spanish Trail—not the club itself. She provides information about membership to help clients understand the full cost of Spanish Trail living and can introduce you to the club\'s membership team for official applications and pricing.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What should I budget for beyond the home purchase?',
    answer:
      'Beyond the home price, Spanish Trail buyers should consider HOA fees (separate from club membership), club initiation fees if joining, and monthly club dues. Dr. Duffy provides estimates for these costs so you can make informed decisions, though she recommends verifying current rates directly with the HOA and club.',
