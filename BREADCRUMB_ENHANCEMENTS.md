## 🔍 Breadcrumb Schema

All breadcrumbs automatically generate schema.org BreadcrumbList markup:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement": [
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 1,
      "name": "Home",
      "item": "https://www.spanishtrailhomes.com/"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 2,
      "name": "Buyers",
      "item": "https://www.spanishtrailhomes.com/buyers"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 3,
      "name": "Specific Page",
      "item": "https://www.spanishtrailhomes.com/specific-page"
    }
  ]
}
```

✅ Schema automatically generated by `<Breadcrumbs>` component
